                            <p>Alsion Early College offers two English courses in the 10th grade to prepare students for college-level reading and writing: AP English Language and AP English Literature. These courses, certified by the CollegeBoard, provide students an opportunity to learn critical reading and writing skills necessary to thrive in college and beyond. Each course culminates in an end-of-year exam designed by the CollegeBoard. Passing the exam with a composite score of 3 out of 5 or higher also earns students college credit that satisfies most English general education requirements at select colleges and universities. Alsionâ€™s 10th-grade program is an intensive study in these two courses (which are typically taken in 11th and 12th grades in most public schools).</p>

                            <p>Alsion's Early College Program gives them a strong head start on college. It offers the opportunity to pursue unique courses not accessible at any other High School institutions through Ohlone College. However, navigating the courses, website, textbook purchases and payments at Ohlone can be fairly daunting. Our Early College director, John Lubushkin, has compiled a set of videos to help incoming students navigate this process.</p>
                            <p>Please find attached the following YouTube videos which display a full presentation of the Early College, and a guide to navigating Ohlone College's website.</p>

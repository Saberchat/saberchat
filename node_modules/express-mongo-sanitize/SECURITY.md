## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the projectâ€™s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report the security issue by email to [tom@studiozeffa.com](mailto:tom@studiozeffa.com).

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
